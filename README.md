How our website jusitfies theme we have selected:
     We browsed through internet regarding different health care facilities available and we got to know that there were less veterinary services as compared to human beings,So we took it on our own to take care of our animal beings so ,we have made Services related to
     Animal healthcare so that atleast no animal die without treatment.Just like human health Care services we provide every possible health care to Animals. 


*  Challenges we faced and how we resolved it:-
   
   -> It was our first collaboration as a team on our first competition ,we didn't knew anything about git and github so first we all learnt github from internet from the same source so any one of us who was unclear of the concept used to solve their doubts.So we learnt teamwork for the first and get to know the benefit of the same in reality  
  
   ->There were times when were stuck on the design of any section be it setting position or width of an element,so we took help of each other and internet documentations and conducted several meetings to resolve them .

   ->We faced many difficulties during the final designing of the website which was to make it responsive,so we used media queries and relative units like rem ,em etc to handle them  .

   ->Sometimes we got bug in our code and were stuck for many times so we used stackoverflow to handle them. 


*  What new thing we learned during making of this website:-
     
     ->Teamwork and working on version control system

     ->Handling of large files and Code bases

     ->We learnt how to use backdrop filter effectively to achieve glassy effects

     ->We learnt how to use different frameworks listed above and how to change their different parameters to achieve different       
     functionalities.

     ->We learnt effective Time Management skills

     ->We learnt how to use stackoverflow to debug our code.
